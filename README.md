Vanilla Seasoning is a personalized modpack that focuses on QoL 
enhancements and various other fancy tweaks while still not breaking the
vanilla experience. This modpack is mostly focused on what I genuinely like to play with, and I'm open to any and all suggestions for what to include. :)

# FAQ

## What can I expect?
A wide variety of mods, ranging from performance improvements (e.g. [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)) to QoL enhancements (e.g. [Mouse Wheelie](https://modrinth.com/mod/mouse-wheelie)) to fancy adjustments and additions (e.g. [Sound Physics Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/sound-physics-remastered)).

## What exact mods does this include?
If you click on whatever version you're using, underneath it is a list of "embedded" mods. There's also some resource packs included, so make sure to enable and mess around with those if you desire!

## How the hell do I install this?
`.mrpack` is Modrinth's amazing modpack format. Please visit [this](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth) article for more information on what they are and how to use them.

## My game won't open D:
Please make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mariospicross/vanilla-seasoning/issues) if you have any compatibility issues, suggestions, etc. :D

## Why are some of the mods disabled?
Whenever a mod becomes incompatible, I simply just disable it. If you have any suggestions for what to replace these with, please let me know.
